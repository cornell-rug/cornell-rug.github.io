The next R User Group meeting is happening on Monday, April 22 from 4-5pm in Warren 137 and on Zoom at this link:
<https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94706896581?pwd=d3JwNjEva05zMnRqcVZuaW5ITkQ2QT09>.

In this meeting, Andrew Siefert from CSCU will be giving a tutorial on using color scales for effective data visualization in R. Since this is the last meeting of the semester, we’ll also have a discussion about people’s interests and ideas for the future of the group.

Hope to see you there!

We’ve posted an updated meeting schedule on our Confluence page (<https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/crug/Spring+2024+meeting+schedule>), so check that out to learn about future events. Leave a comment or email <asiefert@cornell.edu> if you’re interested in presenting at a future meeting!
