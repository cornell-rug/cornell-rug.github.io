Come to the Big Red Barn on Thursday, January 25th anytime between 3 and 5!

Getting R and RStudio set up on your computer can be challenging, but CSCU is here to help! Stop in any time during this session to get help installing R, RStudio, and R packages (such as tidyverse). This is a great opportunity to make sure you're ready to go with R before classes start or attending one of CSCU's R workshops. We can also help troubleshoot pesky package installation issues. Snacks will be provided!

This is an informal "workshop." Bring your laptop by anytime during these hours for help and guidance getting R and RStudio installed and set up on your system!
