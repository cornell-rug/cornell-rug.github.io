### Package Lightning Round

The next R User Group meeting is happening on Thursday, April 11 from 4-5pm in Savage 200 and on Zoom at this link: <https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94706896581?pwd=d3JwNjEva05zMnRqcVZuaW5ITkQ2QT09>.

This meeting will feature an R package lightning round in which everyone will get a chance to tell the group about an R package you are excited about. Plan on giving a quick (no more than 5-minute) introduction to the package including:

* The name of package
* Description and/or quick example of what it does
* How to learn more (e.g., useful resources, vignettes, etc)
 
If you plan to come, please add your package to this sign up sheet: <https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=516037733>.

Hope to see you there!

Weâ€™ve posted an updated meeting schedule on our Confluence page, so check that out to learn about future events.
