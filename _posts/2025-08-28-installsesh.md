Welcome back to the fall semester! For our first activity of the semester, we'll have an R/RStudio installation session September 4th in the big red barn from 3-5. Come by anytime - we'll be chatting with folks, helping people get R/RStudio installed and/or working on computers. Come by if you'd like to get R running on your computer or just to say hi!
