We'll be having our first meeting of the semester on **Tuesday, February 3 at 4pm** in Mann 102 and on Zoom ([link](https://cornell.zoom.us/j/95723147511?pwd=yTARsRFrUPSD3SaHdUAeJiab6obDZI.1)).
 
If you’ve ever had multiple plots that needed to go into the same figure, you know it can be difficult to get things looking right. The [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) library makes this process much smoother - come learn about using the patchwork library to combine plots in intuitive ways.

Snacks will be provided. Hope to see you there!

The R script for this session can be found [**here**](./scripts/patchwork.R)
