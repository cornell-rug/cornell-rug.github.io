We'll be having our last meeting of the semester on **Thursday, December 4 at 4pm** in Mann 102 and on Zoom ([link](https://cornell.zoom.us/j/94426437090?pwd=cHWscPHan36KRxIgkFwbJ3FaLbkFmg.1)).
 
In this meeting, Andrew Siefert from [CSCU](https://cscu.cornell.edu/) will give a demo of [**tidymodels**](https://www.tidymodels.org/), a collection of R packages that provides a unified framework for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.  

Snacks will be provided. Hope to see you there!
