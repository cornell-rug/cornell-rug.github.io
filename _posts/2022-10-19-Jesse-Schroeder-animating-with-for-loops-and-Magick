**_Jesse shows us how to create animated gifs in R using for loops and the Magick package_**

[Live Code from presentation as separate script](https://github.com/JesseS1888/Public/blob/main/animation_script_d_rug.R)

Jesse's script shows how to create frame by frame animations in R. The process, in brief:

1. Create example raster image and timeseries data.
2. Create for loop with each value representing a row from the timeseries data.
3. Create a temporary dataframe with the raster image data offset by the timeseries data at a given timestamp.
4. Create plot of a single frame, and save it as the row number (.png).
5. Use the Magick package to call the saved images and combine them in order as an animation.
6. Save your animation.
