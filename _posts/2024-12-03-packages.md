Dec 3, 4-5pm in Mann 100 (note the room change) and on [Zoom](https://cornell.zoom.us/j/96872016281?pwd=pOanwZwfIJRN7Bhs29wb3g3bs216OJ.1)

R package lightning round! The plan is for everyone to give a quick (~5-minute) introduction to an R package they are excited about, including:

- The name of the package
- Description and/or quick example of what it does
- How to learn more (e.g., useful resources, vignettes, etc.)
