# Cornell R User Group

Welcome to the repo for the Cornell R User Group website, found at cornell-rug.github.io.

This page is forked (with appreciation) from the Davis R User's Group website (https://d-rug.github.io).

## How to make new posts

To make a new post:
- Open the `_posts` folder
- Create a new md file. There are specific rules about naming conventions - it needs to be `year-month-day-name.md`. The `tamplate.md` file can be used as a starting point, so you can make a copy and rename it.
- The contents of the file also have specific rules, many of which are self-explanatory. I've only used the `[meeting]` tag for posts because they've only been meeting announcements, but if we have more post types, we could add more tags. `date:` is the date the post will be viewable, so it can be in the past to make it immediately viewable.
