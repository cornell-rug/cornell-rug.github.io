## Cornell R User Group

The is the homepage of the (soon to be launched) Cornell R User Group - welcome!

The goal of this group is to create a community of R users at Cornell who support each other in using R. It will provide a space for people at all levels to connect and learn skills, methods, and practices in R that they can apply to their research and professional work.

## Come to our initial interest meeting

The first meeting of the Cornell R User Group is happening next Monday (2/19) at 10am in the Big Red Barn. People of all skill levels and roles are welcome. The goal of the meeting is to get to know each other, talk about our interests and what weâ€™d like to get out of the group, and make a plan for future meetings. Coffee will be provided!

If you can't make the meeting, fill out our survey **[here](https://cornell.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dpAUJMX34Vk0Vwi)** to give us ideas of what you'd like from the group - and join the listserv to get updates!

## Join the listserv

To join the listserv, send an email to: r-user-group-L-request@cornell.edu using the subject "join" and a blank message to be added to the listserv.

<!--Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (D-RUG)!  We are a community of R-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for any/all levels to learn from each other. 

 - **Currently we have weekly work sessions every Wednesday from 12pm-2pm** 
  - While we intend to prioritize in-person attendance, there will be a Zoom link in the weekly announcements for people who wish to join remotely
  - **Join the group listserv [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug) to get the Zoom link and weekly reminders**
 - Please see our online forum/discourse site (<a href="https://d-rug.discourse.group/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>), it's a friendly place to post R-related questions, or search for ones that have already been asked!

We have no TAs---just mutual support from folks working on/in R and related topics. A group of D-RUG coordinators help organize and schedule work sessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of R topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

## Join the (e)Mailing List

**Join the group listserv [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug)**. The mailing list is an online supplement to our in-person work sessions. It's our way to post jobs, workshops, etc. If you want to send a message out, let us know!

## Meetings

Meetings are at 360 Shields Library (the Data Lab Space on the third floor of Shields Library, [see these directions and map](http://ds.lib.ucdavis.edu/dsl-location/). We will be following all UC Davis protocols, please see [Campus Ready](https://campusready.ucdavis.edu) for more details.
 
Please come join us, and check the [**calendar**](https://d-rug.github.io/calendar.html) for potential upcoming presentations and workshops!

## Use the resources on this site

We've compiled a list of resources to help you get started using R and find answers to your questions. Our "[Getting Started](https://d-rug.github.io/getting-started.html)" link has some basic info about installing and learning about R. We maintain a question-and-answer forum at the "[Discourse Forum](https://d-rug.discourse.group)" link, and our "[Blog](https://d-rug.github.io/blog/)" is a good resource for the topics that we've discussed in our meetings.
