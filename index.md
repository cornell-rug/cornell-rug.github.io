# Cornell R User's Group

The is the homepage of the (soon to be launched) Cornell R Users' Group - welcome!

The goal of this group is to create a community of R users at Cornell who support each other in using R. It will provide a space for people at all levels to connect and learn skills, methods, and practices in R that they can apply to their research and professional work.

## New to R?

Come to the Big Red Barn on Thursday, January 25th anytime between 3 and 5!

Getting R and RStudio set up on your computer can be challenging, but CSCU is here to help! Stop in any time during this session to get help installing R, RStudio, and R packages (such as tidyverse). This is a great opportunity to make sure you're ready to go with R before classes start or attending one of CSCU's R workshops. We can also help troubleshoot pesky package installation issues. Snacks will be provided!

## Join the listserv

To join the listserv, send an email to: r-user-group-L-request@cornell.edu using the subject "join" and a blank message to be added to the listserv.

<!--Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (D-RUG)!  We are a community of R-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for any/all levels to learn from each other. 

 - **Currently we have weekly work sessions every Wednesday from 12pm-2pm** 
  - While we intend to prioritize in-person attendance, there will be a Zoom link in the weekly announcements for people who wish to join remotely
  - **Join the group listserv [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug) to get the Zoom link and weekly reminders**
 - Please see our online forum/discourse site (<a href="https://d-rug.discourse.group/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>), it's a friendly place to post R-related questions, or search for ones that have already been asked!

We have no TAs---just mutual support from folks working on/in R and related topics. A group of D-RUG coordinators help organize and schedule work sessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of R topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

## Join the (e)Mailing List

**Join the group listserv [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug)**. The mailing list is an online supplement to our in-person work sessions. It's our way to post jobs, workshops, etc. If you want to send a message out, let us know!

## Meetings

Meetings are at 360 Shields Library (the Data Lab Space on the third floor of Shields Library, [see these directions and map](http://ds.lib.ucdavis.edu/dsl-location/). We will be following all UC Davis protocols, please see [Campus Ready](https://campusready.ucdavis.edu) for more details.
 
Please come join us, and check the [**calendar**](https://d-rug.github.io/calendar.html) for potential upcoming presentations and workshops!

## Use the resources on this site

We've compiled a list of resources to help you get started using R and find answers to your questions. Our "[Getting Started](https://d-rug.github.io/getting-started.html)" link has some basic info about installing and learning about R. We maintain a question-and-answer forum at the "[Discourse Forum](https://d-rug.discourse.group)" link, and our "[Blog](https://d-rug.github.io/blog/)" is a good resource for the topics that we've discussed in our meetings.
